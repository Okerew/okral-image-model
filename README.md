Usage
-------------------
The model is not really great and shouldn't be used for anything else than experimenting:
1. It losses some data from epoches
2. It is unstable
3. It bugs out very often
4. For now, it only generates high entropy images

How to add data
-------------------
This is a blueprint for example data
```
[
    {
        "text": "A cat sitting on a couch.",
        "image": "images/cat1.jpg"
    }
]

```
